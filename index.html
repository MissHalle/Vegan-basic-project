      <h1>🌍 Hello! This page is here to talk about Veganism! 🌏</h1>
      <h2>
        🐝 What is <em>Veganism</em>? Veganism is a lifestyle when you choose to
        not eat, wear, or use animal products! 🦈
      </h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        🌱 Veganism is the practice of excluding all animal products; dairy
        (think yogurt, milk, and cheese), any and all meat of any animals (even
        fish), aggs, and honesy. People who go into veganism do so for many
        reasons, here are some popular reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <strong>
          <li>🌎 <span class="reasons"> Enivornmental impact</span></li>
          <li>🐮 <span class="reasons"> Animals wellbeing</span></li>
          <li>🥳 <span class="reasons"> Personal choice</span></li>
          <br />
        </strong>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So even though you may not drink cow milk or eat animal meat as a vegan,
        you can still enjoy a wide variety of milk or meat alternatives made by
        plants and this is true for all non-vegan to vegan options! This is the
        mind set to replace animal products for the animals! 🍄
